Excited to announce my 100 Days of Learning Challenge!

Starting from tomorrow, I'm diving headfirst into a 100-day challenge that will shape my future and take my career to new heights. I've transformed this journey into the "100 Days of Learning and Self Development Challenge". Here's a glimpse of what I'll be undertaking over the next 100 days.

I'll be dedicating my weekdays, Monday to Friday, to intensive learning sessions, mirroring the structure of a typical workweek in an office setting.

Learning DSA from Scratch: For this, I will follow Strivers A2Z DSA Course from TakeUForward and some other resources.

Web Development from Scratch: For this, I will follow the Sigma Web Development Course from Code With Harry and some other resources.

Learning Core Fundamental Subjects: For this, I will follow the Striver Core Sheet and some other resources.

As I take this challenge, I am excited to see how this intense preparation will transform me and lead to remarkable results. It's not just about Learning and for the Placement Purpose, it's also about my personal growth and pushing my career to the next level.

Throughout the next 100 days, I'll be documenting my progress and sharing my learnings. Stay tuned for daily updates on my LinkedIn!

Let's embark on this journey together. Happy learning!
